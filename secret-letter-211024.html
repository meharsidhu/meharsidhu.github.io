          I let you in<br />
          in places I didn't know I kept secret <br />
          so tell me, <br />
          how can we become strangers again <br />
          when you know parts of me <br />
          that I didn't
        </p>
        <p>This is for the times when you say, "mea tenu vadhiya lgno hatju"</p>
        <p class="secret-letter__quotes">
          In all the world, <br />
          there is no heart for me <br />
          like yours. I have been <br />
          with you everytime, I will be there for you <br />
          all the time.
        </p>
        <p>This is for the times when you say, "tu taan chal jana"</p>

          don't be afraid<br />
          because I'm here for you... forever<br />
          I'll love you more that yesterday,<br />
          more than today and keep<br />
          on going until forever.
        </p>
        <p>And for re-assurance</p>
        <p class="secret-letter__quotes">
          you are the finest, loveliest, tenderest, and<br />
          most beautiful person I have ever known -<br />
          and even that is an understatement
